## Hi! I'm Jonah 👋🏼
I am a software engineer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. My expertise and passion are in front-end development. Since high school, I have been building websites by constantly trying new web techniques. I am currently building with React and Vue as my main frameworks. Besides web development, I also build mobile applications for iOS and Android using React Native. I use these frameworks and techniques during my job as a frontend developer at B.made and previously worked at Keylane and Dept.

To gain new insights and broaden my knowledge as a developer I also work as a freelance developer. My business is called JK Agency and we make websites and webshops. Some of my recent work can be found on my [personal website](https://jonahkalkman.nl/work).
