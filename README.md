## Hi! I'm Jonah 👋🏼
I am a software engineer based in Rotterdam, Netherlands. My expertise and passion is frontend development. Since highschool I have been building websites by constantly trying new web techniques. Currently building with React and Vue.js as my main frameworks. Besides webdevelopment, I also build mobile applications for iOS and Android using React Native. I use these frameworks and techniques during my job as frontend developer at B.made and previously worked at Keylane and Dept.

To gain new insights and broaden my knowledge as a developer I also work as a freelance developer. My business is called JK Agency and we make websites and webshops.
